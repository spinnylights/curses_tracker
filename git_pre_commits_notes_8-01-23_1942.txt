audio_sdl.hpp

---

[audio callback fn]

refine the callback to support any SDL audio context

---

[audio callback data]

add callback data struct to Audio

---

[close audio device]

store sdl audio device id in Audio

===

audio_sdl.cpp

---

[g_pos]

initialize g_pos for audio data struct (sort of a hack i could
maybe do away with now that everything is working)

---

[sdl audio device setup]

remove memsets

---

[audio callback fn]

refine the callback to support any SDL audio context

---

[audio callback fn]

actually have the callback get called

---

[audio callback fn]

actually have the callback do something

curve.hpp

---

[soidser default fundmental]

change the default fundamental of Soidser

---

[const CurveAlgs fns]

make process() and inner_process() of the CurveAlgs const
because they are

===

curve.cpp

---

[const CurveAlgs fns]

make process() and inner_process() of the CurveAlgs const
because they are

---

[sample rate futzing]

i should actually have the sample rate be retrieved from SDL

---

[Curve::get() loops around]

have Curve::get() loop around (ultimately this might be better to
do with an unsigned integer index?)

***
===

note.hpp

---

[note range redesign]

change the bottom note to 20 Hz and the top note to ~20,000 Hz

===

note.cpp

---

[debug print note freqs]

some sort of debug print thing

---

[note range redesign]

have notes start at Note(1, 0, 0) instead of Note(0, 0, 0)

***
===

main.cpp

---

[soidser experiments]

try out the new Soidser class
